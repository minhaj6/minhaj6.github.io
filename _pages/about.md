This is Minhaj Uddin Ahmad. I am currently enrolled as a PhD student at the University of Alabama, under the supervision of [Dr. Mizanur Rahmad](https://mrahman.people.ua.edu/). I am working at the [Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM) Lab](https://mrahman.people.ua.edu/cam-lab.html) as a Graduate Research Assistant.
