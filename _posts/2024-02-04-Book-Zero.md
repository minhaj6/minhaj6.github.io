It's a small book. Only a couple hundred pages or a couple of hours in if you are listening to the audio version. Even so, I never thought someone could put together so many words and stories about a single digit (0). 

At first glance, zero seems to be just another mathematical notation. However, the very basic counting numbers are not like other sophisticated math tools that only a few scholars encounter. It has a profound impact on people's thought processes. 

The stories of how different generations and cultures adopted this number are so bizarre that they are almost unbelievable. The more you think about it, the more you start to get it. One canâ€™t let go of hard-wired beliefs, and thinking frameworks easily. The stories might give you a refresher on the rigid nature of human beings. Yet we change.  

I read that book a couple of months ago, so my memory is not quite fresh when I am writing about this. So, I am not putting any quotes or any specific stories here. If you have a couple of hours, maybe give it a try. I am sure you will like the book.
