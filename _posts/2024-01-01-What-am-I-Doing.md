Happy new year! I am redoing my website (yet again) to introduce a proper blogging system. 

In less than 10 days time, a new chapter of my life will have its beginning. I will be travelling halfway across the globe to pursue a doctoral degree at University of Alabama. I've never stepped outside Bangladesh before. 

It takes about five years to complete the doctoral degree if everything goes well. I wish to dedicate this time period toward personal growth, and to do some **meaningful** research work. 

Keeping personal journal has helped me in many ways for last couple of years since I started it. It helps you to look back or keep track of things. But I've never done it publicly (like a mini blog), primarily because it takes extra effort, and no one would want to see it anyway. But still, I wish to post here every week, as I work with different things throughout my PhD journey. It will not strictly about my research, but also things I'm doing/studying for fun (personal interest). 

These posts will be out there but I don't expect that anyone will be interested in these things. They are mostly for me only to keep track of things as I've said earlier. So, the posts maybe quick and untreated. 

Who spends new years eve alone in his room figuring out a static website generator? ME...
